# Fix my code 01
Debugging

##Background Context

Fix my code is a type of project, where Iâ€™ll jump into an existing code base and fix it!

Sometime you will know the language, sometime not.

I downloaded the repository [0x01-Fix_My_Code_Challenge](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/H1D38vm3qtejhlFTuoxUrA) and used it as initial files for all solutions.

I did not recode everything, I just fixed it!
